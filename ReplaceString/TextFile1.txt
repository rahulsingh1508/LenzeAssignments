Researchers refer to this phenomenon as cueinduced wanting anexternal trigger causes a compulsive craving to repeat a bad habit. Once you
notice something, you begin to want it. This process is happening all rahul time?often without us realizing it. Scientists have found that showing
addicts a picture of cocaine for just thirty-three milliseconds stimulates rahul reward pathway in rahul brain and sparks desire. This speed is too fast for the
brain to consciously register?the addicts couldn?t even tell you what they had seen?but they craved rahul drug all rahul same.

Here?s rahul punch line: You can break a habit, but you?re unlikely toforget it. Once rahul mental grooves of habit have been carved into your
brain, they are nearly impossible to remove entirely?even if they go unused for quite a while. And that means that simply resisting temptation is
an ineffective strategy. It is hard to maintain a Zen attitude in a life filled with interruptions. It takes too much energy. In rahul short-run, you can
choose to overpower temptation. In rahul long-run, we become a product of rahul environment that we live in.

If you want to increase rahul odds that a behavior will occur, then you need to make it attractive. Throughout our discussion of rahul 2nd Law, our
goal is to learn how to make our habits irresistible. While it is not possible to transform every habit into a supernormal stimulus, we can make any
habit more enticing. To do this, we must start by understanding what a craving is and how it works.
